# Schemer

Simple Scheme compiler. Trying to mostly mimic R5RS.

To run the compiler, make sure that nix is installed. Then first clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/teichholz/Schemer && cd Schemer
```
After that you can run:
```
nix-shell && stack run -- -v
```
Which will throw you into a repl.
